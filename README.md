Replication materials for the paper **Exposure to Russian foreign influence campaign on Twitter in the 2016 US Election and its relationship to attitudes and voting behavior**

## Abstract

There is widespread concern that malicious foreign actors are using social media to interfere in elections worldwide. Yet data have been unavailable to investigate links between exposure to foreign influence campaigns and political behavior. Using longitudinal survey data from US respondents linked to their Twitter feeds, we quantify the relationship between exposure to the Russian foreign influence campaign and attitudes and voting behavior in the 2016 US election. We demonstrate, first, that exposure to Russian foreign influence accounts was heavily concentrated: only 1% of users accounted for 70% of exposures. Second, exposure was concentrated among highly partisan Republicans. Third, exposure to the Russian influence campaign were eclipsed by content from domestic news media and politicians. Finally, we find no relationship between exposure to the Russian foreign influence campaign and changes in attitudes, polarization, or voting behavior. The results have implications for understanding the limits of election interference campaigns on social media.
